MAME Machine
================

This is a project that will allow students to come and relax in the T-Space after a long day in classes or take a break from homework and projects to play some good old fashioned video games!

The Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator (MAME) machine will be built on top of a Raspberry Pi Microcontroller. The Pi will run the Raspbian operating system and utilize <a href="mamedev.org">MAME</a> to emulate a variety of arcade games from the past. Additionally, the system will feature ROMs written by students to run on the system.
